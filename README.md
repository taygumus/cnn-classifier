# CNN Image Classifier

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) aimed at classifying images into predefined categories. The project is carried out for academic purposes for the master's course in Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing images from a dataset.

- **Model Architecture:** Building a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.

- **Training:** Training the model with appropriate callbacks for checkpoints and early stopping.

- **Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance on validation data.

- **Prediction:** Generating predictions on test data and saving results to a CSV file.
